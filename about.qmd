### Hi There!
I'm a data scientist, I `mutate` :coffee: + :beer: into `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` code.\

### Motivation   
Data science and technology are constantly evolving and keeping up can be difficult. I set up this blog as a tool to share some of the things I've learned with others and for my own posterity. R is my favorite data science language so most of my posts are written in R, but I also use Python, SQL, and others regularly so I try to share content regarding those as well.\

### A bit about me   
Currently, I am a lead data scientist at [84.51Â°](https://www.8451.com/). I live in Portland, OR with my amazing wife Brittany and our twin kiddos. When I'm not working with data, I love to cook, hike, rock-climb, play video games, travel, and explore the Pacific-Northwest.\
