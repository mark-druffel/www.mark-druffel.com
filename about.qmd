### Hi There!
I'm a data scientist, I `mutate` :coffee: + :beer: into `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")` code. 

### Motivation   
Like many data scientists, I started without formal training so I spent a lot of time learning. I set up this blog as a tool to share some of the things I've learned and connect with others.

### A bit about me   
Currently, I am a lead data scientist at [84.51Â°](https://www.8451.com/). I live in Portland, OR with my amazing wife Brittany and our two kids. When I'm not working with data, I love to cook, hike, rock-climb, play video games, travel, and explore the Pacific-Northwest.

If you ever have questions about a post or want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out!\
